            <p>The site you're currently on is an exercise in lightweight web design. Utilizing Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages, it ensures incredibly quick page load times. Regular web pages in this day and age are getting lazy when adding large libraries and dependancies to accomplish fairly simple tasks. Bloated and inconsiderate web pages currently are the norm for users to visit.</p>

            <p>This site loads less than <b>2.0MB</b> onto your device to deliver all its information. Along with the shear speed in which it loads, it still takes into consideration the browser size and device type to deliever a responsive user friendly experience regardless of how you got here.</p>
